PTB-INFO: and possible causes of trouble and how to diagnose and resolve them.

PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is Intel Inc. :: Intel Iris OpenGL Engine :: 2.1 INTEL-10.12.13
PTB-INFO: Renderer has 1536 MB of VRAM and a maximum 1536 MB of texture memory.
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1050 , VBL Endline = -1
PTB-INFO: Beamposition queries unsupported or defective on this system. Using basic timestamping as fallback: Timestamps returned by Screen('Flip') will be less robust and accurate.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 16.674996 ms [59.970029 Hz]. (50 valid samples taken, stddev=0.043905 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 16.666667 ms [60.000000 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.
PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.
PTB-WARNING: DrawText: Failed to load external drawtext plugin [dlopen(libptbdrawtext_ftgl64.dylib, 10): image not found]. Reverting to legacy text renderer.
PTB-WARNING: DrawText: Functionality of Screen('DrawText') and Screen('TextBounds') may be limited and text quality may be impaired.
PTB-WARNING: DrawText: Type 'help DrawTextPlugin' at the command prompt to receive instructions for troubleshooting.

INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 25 times out of a total of 38 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
